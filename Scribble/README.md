# Scribble
Made for Global Game Jam 2025.

Theme: "Bubbles"

Diversifiers used:
- GitHub: Share the source code for your submission in a public GitHub repository and list the URL on your submission page. (duh)
- Easy-read: Ensure all text in your game is large, in a clear sans-serif font, and on plain high contrast backgrounds.
- Time is a flat circle: The ending of your game seamlessly merges back to its beginning in a loop.
